# 🌍 lingual.ai - Real-Time AI Voice Translator

**lingual.ai** is a professional-grade, low-latency voice translation application designed for fluid face-to-face conversations. Powered by the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio** model, it provides near-instant translation with high linguistic accuracy and intelligent UI routing.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Gemini Live Integration**: Utilizes the `@google/genai` Live API for continuous, real-time audio processing and natural-sounding speech output.
- **Dual-Panel Interface**: Features a unique "Face-to-Face" mode where the top panel (Guest) can be flipped 180 degrees, allowing two people to stand opposite each other and read translations comfortably.
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically maps translations to the correct panel using metadata tags. User speech is translated and routed to the Guest (top) panel, while Guest speech is translated and routed to the User (bottom) panel.
- **Bluetooth Optimization**: Built specifically for travelers and professionals using Bluetooth headphones. Includes a dedicated device selector to switch between internal microphones and connected headsets seamlessly.
- **Live Transcription**: Displays real-time transcripts for both participants, ensuring clarity even in noisy environments.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Features a high-contrast dark theme with a prominent **lingual.ai** brand identity in the upper-left corner for professional appeal.

- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API (ScriptProcessorNode, AudioContext) for high-performance audio streaming

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Google Gemini API Key with access to the Native Audio model.
- A modern browser with Microphone permissions enabled.

### Environment Variables
The application expects the following environment variable to be available:
- `process.env.API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API Key.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Select Languages**: Use the flag dropdowns at the top and bottom to set the languages for both participants.
2. **Setup Audio**: Open the **Settings** (gear icon) or click the **Bluetooth** badge to select the correct input source. This is critical when using Bluetooth headphones to ensure the model hears you clearly.
3. **Start Translating**: Tap the large central **Mic** button. The app will enter "Listening" mode.
4. **Natural Conversation**: Simply speak. **lingual.ai** uses intelligent tags (`[USER_UI]` and `[GUEST_UI]`) generated by the AI to route the translated text and audio to the correct person.
5. **Flip for Guest**: Use the **Rotate** button on the left to flip the top panel 180 degrees so your guest can read their translation right-side up.
